		<h1> Affordable Housing Production is Concentrated in Brooklyn and the Bronx </h1>

		<h3> Earlier this month, the New York City Council approved Mayor Eric Adams' City of Yes affordable housing plan in a 31-20 vote. According to the Adams Administration, the plan is expected to create 80,000 homes for New Yorkers over the next 15 years. </h3>

		<p> New Yorkers continue to feel the effects of the ongoing housing crisis. Mayor Eric Adams’ <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/city-of-yes/city-of-yes-housing-opportunity.page">City of Yes for Housing Opportunity </a> aims to address the need for affordable housing by updating current zoning rules in all five boroughs to allow for more development in each neighborhood. </p>

		<p> The Department of Housing Preservation and Development has kept a record of affordable developments by building in each borough, including both new and preservation projects. According to the data, areas in Brooklyn and the Bronx have seen the largest increases in new buildings that provide affordable housing over the last 10 years. With the help of City of Yes, the Department of City Planning plans to avoid overburdening any one area with new developments. </p>

		<p> However, some people still have doubts about whether City of Yes is the solution that the city needs. </p>

		<p> “There are people who will tell you that simply adding housing to the total supply will ultimately bring down the cost of housing,” said Laura Wolf-Powers, a professor of urban planning at Hunter College. “But I think that the evidence on that is pretty ambiguous.” </p>

		<p> She said that although the plan had improved from its original proposal, she believes that New Yorkers would better benefit from the preservation of current affordable housing like NYCHA, or the investment of funding into housing voucher programs. </p>
